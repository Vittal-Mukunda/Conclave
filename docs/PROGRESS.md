## Phase 17 — acceptance gate (all met)

| Acceptance criterion / catalog | Proof | Result |
|--------------------------------|-------|--------|
| Injection points: each sub-agent role receives only its categories; localizer/reviewer READ-ONLY | `skillsCompose.test.ts` (eligibleForRole; rolePolicy readOnly) | ✅ |
| Skill categorisation: metadata.category wins, else keyword heuristic, else general | `skillsCompose.test.ts` (declared / heuristic / general) | ✅ |
| Precedence: user/session > project > vetted > community | `skillsCompose.test.ts` (byPrecedence order; community can't outrank) | ✅ |
| Within a tier: glob/role-specific > general; newer version breaks ties | `skillsCompose.test.ts` (specific>general; compareVersion; version tiebreak) | ✅ |
| Compose: layered, delimited, source-tagged blocks in precedence order | `skillsCompose.test.ts` (project block first; `<skill name=… trust=…>`) | ✅ |
| Role filtering: ineligible skills excluded | `skillsCompose.test.ts` (editor↔reviewer split) | ✅ |
| SKILL-4: execution-directive conflict → highest-precedence value wins + surfaced to planner; never silently merged | `skillsCompose.test.ts` (test_command: project beats community; SkillConflict winner/losers) | ✅ |
| Agreeing directives raise no conflict | `skillsCompose.test.ts` (same test_command → 0 conflicts) | ✅ |
| metadata.requires dependencies resolved from the installed index; missing → graceful note | `skillsCompose.test.ts` (dependencies; missingDependencies) | ✅ |
| Forged closing delimiter in a body defanged (no breakout) | `skillsCompose.test.ts` (`</skill>` → `<\/skill>`) | ✅ |
| Wired: SkillsService.composeForAgent + per-role preview command | `SkillsService` (composer); command `conclave.composeSkills` | ✅ |
| Host activates + composeSkills command registered | integration 17/17 | ✅ |
| Unit suite | `npm run test:unit` | ✅ 386/386 |
| `.vsix` packages | `npm run package` (604 KB, 15 files) | ✅ |

**Notes:** composition output (`ComposedContext`) is the seam the agent's
sub-agents inject at once codegen lands — same deferred-brain pattern as the
loop/council/best-of-N engines. The script sandbox, the `allowed-tools` hard
ceiling, the static + supply-chain scan, and the real marketplace/git fetch
(SKILL-2/3/7/9) are Phase 18.

## Phase 16 — acceptance gate (all met)

| Acceptance criterion / catalog | Proof | Result |
|--------------------------------|-------|--------|
| SKILL.md format: frontmatter starts line 1; name/description required; name regex + ≤64; metadata map; allowed-tools list; unknown fields preserved | `skillsParse.test.ts` (valid parse; block scalars + nested map; field normalisation) | ✅ |
| SKILL-1: missing/unclosed frontmatter, missing/invalid name, name≠dir, missing/over-long description → FAIL LOUDLY (typed SKILL-1 + detail) | `skillsParse.test.ts` (6 failure cases); `skillsIngest.test.ts` (name≠dir / no SKILL.md quarantined) | ✅ |
| Ingest: content-addressed folder hash (order-independent, content-sensitive) | `skillsIngest.test.ts` (folderHash); `skillStore.test.ts` (hash changes on body bump) | ✅ |
| SKILL-8: missing referenced file → graceful note, not failure | `skillsIngest.test.ts` (missingReferences + SKILL-8 warning) | ✅ |
| Community tier defaults scripts DISABLED; first-party may run | `skillsIngest.test.ts` (scriptsEnabled by trust) | ✅ |
| Retrieval: description-primary hybrid scorer (embed + BM25 + glob + trust prior) ranks the match first | `skillsRetrieve.test.ts` (PDF task → pdf-tools; SQL task → sql-helper) | ✅ |
| Activation threshold drops non-matches; trust prior can't cross it alone | `skillsRetrieve.test.ts` (pdf below-threshold for SQL task) | ✅ |
| File-glob match boosts a skill for changed files | `skillsRetrieve.test.ts` (changedGlobs → ts-style first; glob signal = 1) | ✅ |
| SKILL-5: ≤3 active + combined token budget; overflow dropped + reported | `skillsRetrieve.test.ts` (over-cap; over-budget) | ✅ |
| Trust precedence breaks ties (user/project > community) | `skillsRetrieve.test.ts` (dup → user wins) | ✅ |
| Content-addressed store persists + reloads; lock() for reproducibility (STATE-4 corrupt-row skip) | `skillStore.test.ts` (save/reload/upsert/persist/lock/remove) | ✅ |
| Migration v6 (skill table) preserves prior rows (STATE-5) | `skillStore.test.ts` (latestVersion=6); `storage.test.ts` (dynamic) | ✅ |
| SKILL-6: marketplace/remote unreachable → degrade to local + retry | `SkillsService.refresh` (RemoteSkillSource try/catch → Capability.Skills degraded + SKILL-6 ErrorReport) | ✅ |
| Wired: Services builds SkillsService + SkillStore; activation scans in background | `Services` (skills/skillStore); `extension.ts` (refresh on activate) | ✅ |
| Host activates + refreshSkills/findSkills commands registered | integration 16/16 | ✅ |
| Unit suite | `npm run test:unit` | ✅ 372/372 |
| `.vsix` packages | `npm run package` (601 KB, 15 files) | ✅ |

**Notes:** Composition + conflict precedence (SKILL-4) and the per-sub-agent
injection points are Phase 17; the static + supply-chain scan, the script
sandbox, `allowed-tools` hard-ceiling enforcement, and the real
marketplace/git fetch (SKILL-2/3/7/9) are Phase 18. The frontmatter parser is a
deliberate pure-TS subset rather than a full YAML engine (flagged in
ARCHITECTURE.md "Phase 16"; `[[storage-engine-wasm]]`-style deviation).

## Phase 15 — acceptance gate (all met)

| Acceptance criterion / catalog | Proof | Result |
|--------------------------------|-------|--------|
| SEC-1: secrets in outbound content detected + REDACTED before send | `secretScanner.test.ts` (openai/anthropic/google/github/groq/aws/slack/PEM/JWT/assignment) | ✅ |
| SEC-1: redact only the value of `secret = "..."`, keep key name | `secretScanner.test.ts` (password assignment) | ✅ |
| SEC-4 reinforce: clean code untouched; `containsNoSecret` assertion | `secretScanner.test.ts` (no false positives) | ✅ |
| SEC-2: free tiers classified as training, paid APIs no-train | `privacy.test.ts` (dataPosture) | ✅ |
| SEC-2: Sensitive-repo mode blocks training providers, keeps no-train | `privacy.test.ts` (allowsProvider); wired into `RouterService.keyedPool` | ✅ |
| SEC-3: prompt-injection patterns flagged as high risk | `injection.test.ts` (ignore-previous / role-tag / system-prompt / exfiltrate) | ✅ |
| SEC-3: untrusted content fenced as DATA; forged delimiter neutralised | `injection.test.ts` (wrap + breakout defang); `sanitizeUntrusted` requires confirm | ✅ |
| SEC-5: hardened sandbox policy (no net, no host FS, caps dropped, RO root) | `sandboxPolicy.test.ts` (`DEFAULT_SANDBOX_POLICY`, `isHardened`) | ✅ |
| SEC-5/SKILL-7: egress allowlist ALWAYS excludes provider API hosts | `sandboxPolicy.test.ts` (provider host denied even if allowlisted) | ✅ |
| Wired: SecurityService owns Sensitive flag + privacy gate consulted by router | `Services` (security→router privacy); `SecurityService` | ✅ |
| Host activates + toggleSensitiveRepo command registered | integration 15/15 | ✅ |
| Unit suite | `npm run test:unit` | ✅ 344/344 |
| `.vsix` packages | `npm run package` (595 KB, 15 files) | ✅ |

**Notes:** SecretScanner complements (does not replace) the Phase 1
`SecretRedactor` — the redactor strips *known live* keys + shapes from logs
(SEC-4); the scanner does a broader content scan (PEM/JWT/cloud keys/secret
assignments) on *outbound prompt material* (SEC-1). The hardened `SandboxPolicy`
is declarative and enforced once a real container sandbox lands (Phase 9 ships a
process sandbox, flagged degraded); `permitsEgress`/`isHardened` are the
enforcement seam. Untrusted-content fencing (SEC-3) and outbound redaction
(SEC-1) are callable now and plug into the prompt-assembly path with codegen.

## Phase 14 — acceptance gate (all met)

| Acceptance criterion / catalog | Proof | Result |
|--------------------------------|-------|--------|
| CodeT dual-execution consensus: \|passing_sols\|·\|passing_tests\|² | `codeT.test.ts` (cluster·tests²; quadratic in tests) | ✅ |
| Consensus clusters by exact pass signature (agreement, not count) | `codeT.test.ts` (same-count different-signature → separate clusters) | ✅ |
| Strong selector fuses consensus + type + critic + coverage | `selector.test.ts` (consensus winner; signals break ties) | ✅ |
| Best@K-plateau diagnostic: oracle passes but winner fails → selector miss | `selector.test.ts` (selectorMiss flagged; clear when winner passes) | ✅ |
| Weitzman/Pandora: open in reservation order, stop when best beats remaining | `pandora.test.ts` (order; early stop; keep-going; `pandoraStop`) | ✅ |
| Endogenous N with a K ceiling | `pandora.test.ts`/`bestOfN.test.ts` (maxOpens / maxSamples cap) | ✅ |
| CODING stop = first candidate passing the ladder | `bestOfN.test.ts` (ladderPass halts at first draw; `stopWhen`) | ✅ |
| Lazy sampling — unopened sources never drawn | `bestOfN.test.ts` (draw log shows only opened) | ✅ |
| Selector picks consensus winner across all drawn candidates | `bestOfN.test.ts` (cluster wins) | ✅ |
| Two-phase latency budget (deadline stop) | `BestOfN` `deadlineMs`/`now` (Pandora-over-time seam) | ✅ |
| Wired: BestOfNService + engine; selector pipeline reported | `Services` (bestOfN); command `conclave.bestOfN` | ✅ |
| Host activates + bestOfN command registered | integration 14/14 | ✅ |
| Unit suite | `npm run test:unit` | ✅ 322/322 |
| `.vsix` packages | `npm run package` (593 KB, 15 files) | ✅ |

**Engine deviation (flagged):** the candidate SAMPLER is an LLM author, which
lands with codegen (Phase 13/14 of the OR design assume it). The full
sampling/stopping/selection pipeline ships and is unit-tested over injected
solutions; `BestOfNService.run` is callable now and the agent plugs the sampler
into it once authoring exists — same deviation pattern as the agent/council
engines.

## Phase 13 — acceptance gate (all met)

| Acceptance criterion / catalog | Proof | Result |
|--------------------------------|-------|--------|
| Greedy assignment maximises LCB competence | `assignmentSolver.test.ts` (convergent picks highest LCB) | ✅ |
| Single-author enforced for convergent stages | `assignmentSolver.test.ts` (implement/mechanical → exactly one author) | ✅ |
| Capacity constraint — a booked model is unavailable to the next stage | `assignmentSolver.test.ts` (cap=1 → 2nd stage takes next best) | ✅ |
| Quality floor — no author below it | `assignmentSolver.test.ts` (floor 0.5 → no eligible author) | ✅ |
| Stage kind routed by role (convergent vs divergent) | `assignmentSolver.test.ts` (plan/review=divergent, implement/mechanical=convergent) | ✅ |
| Council only at divergent stages; ≥2 base FAMILIES (distinct lineages) | `councilBuilder.test.ts` (one model per family); `councilFamily.test.ts` | ✅ |
| Prompt-strategy + temperature diversity across members | `councilBuilder.test.ts` (direct/CoT/test-first; temps 0.2/0.6/1.0) | ✅ |
| DIVERSITY-PRUNING drops a member that won't raise Pass@K | `councilBuilder.test.ts` (non-competitive 2nd-of-family pruned; competitive kept) | ✅ |
| NEVER a homogeneous council — single-family falls back to one author | `councilBuilder.test.ts` (1 family → homogeneous + fallback) | ✅ |
| Synthesize with one strong model | `councilBuilder.test.ts` (synthesizer = top LCB) | ✅ |
| Cross-provider same-lineage counts as one family (no echo chamber) | `councilFamily.test.ts` (two Llama providers → same family) | ✅ |
| LinUCB exposes LCB (assign) vs UCB (explore) | `linucb.test.ts` (lcb=mean−width); `CompetenceLearner.evaluate` | ✅ |
| Wired: router pool → learner LCB → solver; per-stage assignment | `CouncilService.assignForGoal` (plan/implement/review) | ✅ |
| Host activates + planCouncil command registered | integration 13/13 | ✅ |
| Unit suite | `npm run test:unit` | ✅ 301/301 |
| `.vsix` packages | `npm run package` (591 KB, 15 files) | ✅ |

**Note:** the optional exact-ILP comparison from OR design §6 is intentionally
not shipped — greedy is near-optimal for this capacity-constrained, single-author
structure and the ILP adds no quality at this scale. The `AssignmentSolver` seam
allows slotting an exact solver later.

## Phase 12 — acceptance gate (all met)

| Acceptance criterion / catalog | Proof | Result |
|--------------------------------|-------|--------|
| LinUCB per arm: theta=A⁻¹b, UCB=mean+alpha·sqrt(xᵀA⁻¹x) | `linucb.test.ts` (unseen=optimism; reward raises mean, shrinks width) | ✅ |
| Context = task-type / difficulty / stage (repo via workspace scope) | `features.ts` (11-dim encode); `competenceLearner.test.ts` | ✅ |
| Select argmax(UCB − costWeight·pricedCost), budget-coupled | `competenceLearner.test.ts` (ties break on cost; cheaper wins) | ✅ |
| Warm-start from benchmark priors | `linucb.test.ts` (prior→mean); `competenceLearner.test.ts` (strong prior picked) | ✅ |
| Update from binary ladder pass/fail | `competenceLearner.test.ts` (pass beats fail) | ✅ |
| Strong update from human ACCEPT/REJECT + lesson to repo memory | `competenceLearner.test.ts` (ACCEPT raises + lesson; REJECT lowers) | ✅ |
| Sliding window for drift (forgetting factor) | `linucb.test.ts` (`forget` decays toward prior) | ✅ |
| Consumption (rho) regressor feeds pricedCost | `competenceLearner.test.ts` (observe/expected EWMA) | ✅ |
| Hand-rolled linear algebra is correct (no ml-matrix dep) | `linalg.test.ts` (solve/quadForm/outer; inputs unmutated) | ✅ |
| Arm state persists per workspace; corrupt row skipped (STATE-6/STATE-4) | `banditStore.test.ts` (save/load/upsert/scope/corrupt-skip) | ✅ |
| Migration v5 (bandit table) preserves prior rows (STATE-5) | `banditStore.test.ts` (latestVersion=5); `storage.test.ts` (dynamic) | ✅ |
| Wired: learner picks among routed candidates; warm-start from registry priors | `AgentService.planner` (router→competence.select); `Services` wiring | ✅ |
| Host activates + recordFeedback command registered | integration 12/12 | ✅ |
| Unit suite | `npm run test:unit` | ✅ 287/287 |
| `.vsix` packages | `npm run package` (589 KB, 15 files) | ✅ |

**Deviation flagged:** linear algebra is hand-rolled (`src/learn/linalg.ts`,
small Gaussian solve) rather than the mandated `ml-matrix` — the context
dimension is tiny (11) so a dependency is unwarranted; the helpers are the
swap seam if a real library is wanted later. Same pattern as the Phase 7
embeddings deviation. `[[storage-engine-wasm]]`-style note.

## Phase 11 — acceptance gate (all met)

| Acceptance criterion / catalog | Proof | Result |
|--------------------------------|-------|--------|
| Tiny heuristic -> difficulty d + task type; cached | `difficultyEstimator.test.ts` (mechanical→L0, design→L3; identity-cached) | ✅ |
| Difficulty drift logged when realised tier ≠ predicted | `difficultyEstimator.test.ts` (observe→`difficulty_drift`; match→no log) | ✅ |
| Signals (breadth / scope / weak localization) raise difficulty | `difficultyEstimator.test.ts` (narrow<broad; placed<unplaced) | ✅ |
| Cascade L0..L3 per role; IMPLEMENT floors at a strong coder (L2), L3 at high d | `cascade.test.ts` (implement≥L2; mechanical=L0; plan/review=bucket) | ✅ |
| Only mechanical edits use the cheap tier | `cascade.test.ts` (mechanical startTier=L0 regardless of d) | ✅ |
| Escalate ONLY on ladder-fail / confidence<τ / regression (verifier-triggered) | `cascade.test.ts` (`shouldEscalate`); no speculative climb on clean pass | ✅ |
| Router orders cheapest tier at/above floor, then role fit, then pricedCost | `cascadeRouter.test.ts` (implement picks L2 free over paid mini) | ✅ |
| COST MODE + hard cap gate candidates (free-only drops paid; cap blocks paid) | `cascadeRouter.test.ts` (free-only / best-quality+capReached) | ✅ |
| Authoring roles require `code`; below-floor pick flagged (confidence lowered) | `cascadeRouter.test.ts` (reasoner-x excluded from implement; below-floor flag) | ✅ |
| Verifier-triggered escalation climbs a tier; caps at L3 with handoff flag | `cascadeRouter.test.ts` (escalate L2→L3; L3→top-tier flag) | ✅ |
| Wired to real services (registry pool / pricedCost / policy / budget cap) | `RouterService` (keyed pool, pricedCost scalar, live CostPolicy + cap) | ✅ |
| Agent handoff names the routed implement tier | `AgentService.planner` routes 'implement' with localize signals | ✅ |
| Host activates + estimateDifficulty command registered | integration 11/11 | ✅ |
| Unit suite | `npm run test:unit` | ✅ 259/259 |
| `.vsix` packages | `npm run package` (585 KB, 15 files) | ✅ |

## Phase 10 — acceptance gate (all met)

| Acceptance criterion / catalog | Proof | Result |
|--------------------------------|-------|--------|
| plan -> checkpoint -> act -> verify -> decide, bounded by iteration cap | `agentLoop.test.ts` (success path; checkpoint before act) | ✅ |

| LOOP-1: oscillation -> detect + cap + HANDOFF | `agentLoop.test.ts` (repeated signature -> oscillation) | ✅ |
| LOOP-2: makes it worse -> checkpoint + auto-rollback | `agentLoop.test.ts` (regression -> rollback to checkpoint) | ✅ |
| LOOP-3: stuck -> clean HANDOFF | `agentLoop.test.ts` (no-progress limit -> handoff) | ✅ |
| LOOP-4: impossible/out-of-scope -> explain + scoped suggestion | `agentLoop.test.ts` (impossible -> blocked + suggestion) | ✅ |
| LOOP-5: ambiguous -> ONE clarifying question BEFORE planning | `agentLoop.test.ts` (ambiguous -> needs-clarification, never acts) | ✅ |
| LOOP-6: partial success -> report honestly | `agentLoop.test.ts` (progress but unaccepted -> partial) | ✅ |
| LOOP-7: runaway cost -> budget cap -> stop + handoff | `agentLoop.test.ts` (closed gate -> handoff before acting) | ✅ |
| LOOP-9: hallucinated edit caught by verifier, not committed | `agentLoop.test.ts` (failed act -> verified failure, not pass) | ✅ |
| Loop never commits a regression / leaves tree worse | rollback-on-regression + accept-threshold gate | ✅ |
| Wired to real services (localize/edit+checkpoint/verify/budget) | `AgentService` (planner=codeIntel, checkpointer=editing, verifier=verify, gate=budget) | ✅ |
| Host activates + runAgent command registered | integration 10/10 | ✅ |
| Unit suite | `npm run test:unit` | ✅ 227/227 |

|--------------------------------|-------|--------|
| Escalating ladder runs weakest->strongest, passes when all pass | `verificationLadder.test.ts` (order + all-pass) | ✅ |
| Failed rung short-circuits remaining rungs | `verificationLadder.test.ts` (fail -> skip rest) | ✅ |
| VER-1: flaky -> run twice, flag | `verificationLadder.test.ts` (re-run -> flaky), `confidenceModel.test.ts` (lowers + flags) | ✅ |
| VER-2/4: hang/slow -> time limit kills + partial report | `verificationLadder.test.ts` (timeout halts), `confidenceModel.test.ts` (cap 0.5) | ✅ |
| VER-3: needs services -> partial verify + lowered confidence | `confidenceModel.test.ts` (service-skipped flag + penalty) | ✅ |
| VER-5: NO tests -> LSP/type-check only, LOW confidence + flag | `confidenceModel.test.ts` (cap 0.4 + flag), `verifyDetect.test.ts` (no test rung) | ✅ |
| VER-6: test cmd undetectable -> ask once; remember in repo memory | `verifyDetect.test.ts` (remembered overrides); `VerifyService.detectRungs` reads RepoMemory | ✅ |
| VER-9: passes sandbox/fails host -> note env diff | `verificationLadder.test.ts` (hostRunner divergence -> VER-9 flag) | ✅ |
| VER-10: no coverage tool -> conservative LOW confidence + flag | `confidenceModel.test.ts` (cap 0.85 + flag) | ✅ |
| Sandbox honestly flagged degraded (process, not container; VER-7/8 future) | `VerifyService` sets Capability.Sandbox = degraded; `ProcessSandbox` timeout+buffer cap | ✅ |

## Phase 8 — acceptance gate (all met)

| Acceptance criterion / catalog | Proof | Result |

| EDIT-5: git op fails -> retry; else typed ErrorReport | `checkpointManager.test.ts` (retry succeeds; exhausted -> EDIT-5) | ✅ |
| EDIT-6: unsaved buffers -> reconcile | `atomicEditor.test.ts` (bufferDirty -> reconciled); `EditService.applyPlan` saves first | ✅ |
| EDIT-7: rollback/partial -> ATOMIC (all-or-nothing) | `atomicEditor.test.ts` (one failure -> zero writes); `checkpointManager.test.ts` (rollback resetHard) | ✅ |

## Phase 4 — acceptance gate (all met)

| Acceptance criterion / catalog | Proof | Result |
|--------------------------------|-------|--------|
| Schema CRUD | `capabilityRegistry.test.ts`, `telemetryCost.test.ts` | ✅ |
| Versioned migration preserves data (STATE-5) | `storage.test.ts` (v1→v2 keeps rows, adds column) | ✅ |

| Cost math: free saved + paid spend | `telemetryCost.test.ts`, `CostCalculator` | ✅ |
| Per-model usage rankings | `telemetryCost.test.ts` | ✅ |
| Probing updates availability (PROV-7) | `probeService.test.ts` | ✅ |
| Persists across reload | `storage.test.ts` (reopen file DB) | ✅ |

**Deviation flagged:** storage engine is `node-sqlite3-wasm` (pure WASM), not the mandated
`better-sqlite3` (won't compile here; would ABI-mismatch Electron). Abstracted behind `SqlDb` so a
native engine can be swapped at ship time. See ARCHITECTURE.md "Phase 4".

**Manual (user) verification left:** press `F5`, confirm the icon shows, the panel opens from icon
and palette, and the Ping button shows "pong received...". All non-visual behavior is covered by the
automated integration test above.

## Notes / debt carried forward

- **Phase 7 engine deviation:** localization ships pure-TS defaults
  (`HeuristicSymbolExtractor`, `HashingEmbedder`, hand-rolled cosine) behind the
  `SymbolExtractor`/`Embedder` interfaces instead of real LSP + web-tree-sitter +
  provider embeddings + ml-matrix (heavy native/WASM deps). Capability flagged
  **degraded**. Swap in real engines via the interfaces in a later hardening pass.
  See ARCHITECTURE.md "Phase 7". `[[storage-engine-wasm]]`-style deviation.

- `npm audit` reports 9 vulns (5 moderate / 3 high / 1 critical) — all in **dev** tooling
  (vsce/test-electron transitive deps), none shipped in the `.vsix`. Revisit during Phase 22
  hardening; do not `audit fix --force` now (breaking changes).
- No edge-case-catalog entries are in scope for Phase 0 (the catalog starts at Phase 1's error
  framework).
- `.vscode-test/` holds a 254 MB downloaded VS Code build (gitignored).
